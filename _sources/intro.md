The aim of the workshop is to bring together leading researchers and practitioners to discuss the issues around appropriate and alternative assessment methodologies, incorporation of testing and monitoring data, code development and calibration etc. as well as to present examples of best practice from international participants. The timing of the workshop is very appropriate given the current activity to develop a Eurocode part on the Basis of Assessment and Retrofitting of Existing Structures. A series of invited lectures on selected topics will be delivered by industry and academic leaders, which will be followed by moderated panel discussions. The event promises to be of great interest to those involved in this important area.
